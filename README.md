## Features

### 🔐 Touch ID Protection
Lock your clipboard history behind biometrics. 30-second grace period means no repeated prompts.

### ⌨️ Keyboard-First Design
- **⌘⇧V** — Open clipboard history
- **⌘⌃1-9** — Paste items 1-9 instantly
- **⌘⇧⌥V** — Paste as plain text
- **↑↓ or j/k** — Navigate through history

### 📌 Pin Favorites
Keep frequently-used text always accessible. Pinned items never expire.

### 🔍 Instant Search
Filter your entire clipboard history as you type.

### 🛡️ Privacy & Security
- **Password protection** — Detects transient clipboard types (1Password, Dashlane, etc.) and blocks them
- **Excluded apps** — Block sensitive apps from clipboard capture entirely
- **Touch ID** — Require authentication to view history
- **Encrypted storage** — History file uses macOS file protection

### 📱 App Source Attribution
See which app each clip came from with its icon. Know if that text came from Slack, VS Code, or Safari.

### 🔢 Smart Organization
- **Duplicate detection** — Identical clips automatically consolidate
- **Paste count badges** — Track how many times you've used each item
- **Compact timestamps** — See "2h" or "3d" instead of verbose dates

### ⚙️ Customization
- **Menu bar icon styles** — Choose between List or Minimal
- **Sound effects** — Optional audio feedback when copying
- **History size** — Control how many clips to keep

### 🎨 Native macOS Design
Built with SwiftUI. Looks right at home on Sonoma, Sequoia, and Tahoe. Auto-updates via Sparkle.

### 🖱️ Click to Paste
Single-click any item to paste instantly. Right-click for more options (Pin, Delete, Paste as Plain Text).
