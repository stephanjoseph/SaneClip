## [1.2] - 2026-01-25

### Removed
- **iCloud Sync** — Removed CloudKit sync infrastructure pending Apple Developer provisioning resolution
- **End-to-End Encryption** — Removed encryption service (was for sync feature)
- **Sync Settings UI** — Removed sync settings panel from preferences

### Changed
- **100% Local** — All clipboard data now stays entirely on-device
- **Simplified architecture** — Reduced complexity by removing sync-related code

### Technical
- Deleted `CloudKitSyncService.swift`, `EncryptionService.swift`, `SyncSettingsView.swift`
- Updated entitlements to remove iCloud containers
- Distribution now via Cloudflare R2 (dist.saneclip.com)

### Note
iCloud sync may return in a future version once provisioning issues are resolved. The current version is fully functional as a local-only clipboard manager.
