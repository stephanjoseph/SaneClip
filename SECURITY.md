3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **Enable Touch ID** if you handle sensitive data
2. **Review excluded apps** to ensure password managers are blocked
3. **Clear history** before sharing your screen
4. **Keep updated** — enable automatic updates in Settings

## Threat Model

SaneClip is designed for individual users on personal Macs. It is NOT designed for:

- Enterprise/multi-user environments (no access controls)
- Highly sensitive data (consider dedicated password managers)
- Air-gapped or compliance-regulated systems
